# Pointcloud Scattering

This repository contains code for _"The Manifold Scattering Transform for High-Dimensional Point Cloud Data"_
#### Abstract

The manifold scattering transform is a deep fea-
ture extractor for data defined on a Riemannian
manifold. It is one of the first examples of extend-
ing convolutional neural network-like operators to
general manifolds. The initial work on this model
focused primarily on its theoretical stability and
invariance properties but did not provide meth-
ods for its numerical implementation except in
the case of two-dimensional surfaces with prede-
fined meshes. In this work, we present practical
schemes, based on the theory of diffusion maps,
for implementing the manifold scattering trans-
form to datasets arising in naturalistic systems,
such as single cell genetics, where the data is a
high-dimensional point cloud modeled as lying
on a low-dimensional manifold. We show that our
methods are effective for signal classification and
manifold classification tasks.
